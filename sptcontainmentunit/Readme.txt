Maze Runner Game
Description
Maze Runner is a 2D top-down game where the player must navigate through procedurally generated mazes, avoid enemies, and reach the exit to progress through levels. The game features different obstacles, interactive objects like keys and shields, and a boss battle on each level. It is built using LibGDX, a Java-based game development framework.

Requirements
* Java 17 or later
* Gradle 
* LibGDX dependencies (will be fetched automatically by Gradle)
When running the game through IntelliJ, ensure that -XonStartThread VM option is removed if the operating system is Windows or Linux.

How to Play
* Navigate using W, A, S, D keys or arrows.
* During cutscenes press SPACE to go next  or ENTER to skip
* Defeat the Boss, it will spawn a Key somewhere on the map.
* Pick up a Key to unlock the Teleporter.
* Collect Shields to become temporarily invulnerable.
* Collect extra lives.
* Avoid Enemies, on contact with them you lose life.
* Follow an arrow on the top to reach a Teleporter, if you have a Key.
* Avoid Traps, they can damage you or reduce your speed.


Point System
You get 
* 5 points for every picked up life,
* 10 points for every picked up shield,
* 100 points for collecting the key,
* 500 points for defeating the boss

You lose
* 50 points for any sort of damage taken.
